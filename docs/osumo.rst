Offline SUMO
============

The primary documentation for offline sumo lives here:
https://osumo.readthedocs.org. The source lives at
https://gihub.com/mozilla/osumo.

Offline SUMO requires a component on Kitsune and this component relies heavily
on Redis as we generate all the articles once a day and put it into
Kitsune. Make sure that is available.
